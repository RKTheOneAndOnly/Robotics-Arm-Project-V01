# Robotics-Arm-Project-V01


This project is a self-initiated robotic arm designed and developed to showcase modular design, 3D printing, electronic control, and robotics expertise. The project is in its Version 1 (V01) stage, with plans for further iterations based on learnings.

## Features

### 1. Modular 3D Printed Design
The robotic arm consists of 3D-printed modular components, making it easy to assemble, repair, and customize. Each part is designed to be lightweight and efficient, ensuring high performance with minimal material usage.

- **Modularity:** The design allows for quick assembly/disassembly and swapping of individual components.
- **STL Files Provided:** All 3D model files are available in the `Files` directory for easy reproduction.
- **Customizability:** Modify and print parts to adapt the arm to various tasks.

### 2. 3 Degrees of Freedom (3DOF)
The arm provides three degrees of freedom, enabling it to move with precision and flexibility in various planes, making it suitable for multiple applications like pick-and-place or demonstration of robotic motion principles.

### 3. Electronic Control System
An integrated control system powers the arm using microcontrollers, servos, and stepper motors.

- **Programming:** Code written in [C++/Python].
- **Control Methods:** Supports manual input or automated control through programmed sequences.

### 4. Learning-Focused
This project serves as a platform for understanding:
- 3D printing techniques.
- Robotics and kinematics principles.
- Control of robots.

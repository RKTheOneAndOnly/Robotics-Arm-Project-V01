The Arduino code needs to be uploaded onto the Arduino Uno board.

The Python code PYTHON_CONTROLLER can be run using the pyserial and keyboard modules. To install the required dependencies, use the following command:

pip install pyserial ; pip installkeyboard

Using this script, you can map the following keys to control the robot's movements:

+ : Base rotates clockwise
- : Base rotates counterclockwise
W : Rotate Arm 1 counterclockwise
S : Rotate Arm 1 clockwise
A : Rotate Arm 2 counterclockwise
D : Rotate Arm 2 clockwise
0 : Park the robot at the defined parking joint angles
O : Open/Close the gripper
Q : Quit the code

This intuitive key mapping allows easy control of the robot's movement and positioning.
